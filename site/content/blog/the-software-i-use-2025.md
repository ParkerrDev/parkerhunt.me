Today is Febuary 8th 2025, I will probably continue to update this particular blog post over the next few days.

(This blog is updated in real-time as I write it)

This is my first blog of my yearly series that will cover the software that I use on a daily basis to get a sense of what softwares prevail over the years compared to others and to see how it changes for myself. Its all about survival of the fittest software. The goal is to gain insight in which direction the tech landscape is shifting, and using this knowledge I can approximate how viable a software idea is for the future.


### Operating System: NixOS, Windows 11

NixOS. So. How do I put this. Theres a lot right with it, but I don't know, I mean, do you think the piece is working?
It is a love hate relationship that I have with NixOS. It has many problems fundementally, but also it is fundementally a better operating system. I am still undecided on it. I really love it, but I also really really hate it. I also use Windows when I have to, or when NixOS is giving me trouble. Windows 11 is much nicer compared to 10. So I hate Windows less these days but I'd still much rather prefer to use Linux, even if just for its FOSS spirit. If your wondering, I would use MacOS if I had a Macbook, but I am poor. :(

If your interested in how I configure NixOS you can check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/ParkerrDev/dotfiles). 


### Window Manager: Hyprland


### Browser: Brave

I use brave because firefox sucks balls. Brave is well regarded for their focus on privacy and security, if you are still using regular chrome this day and age you mine as well just sell your soul at this point. But Seriously the geckodriver sucks balls. The chromium web driver is way faster and it has basically won in the browser race at this point. Now you can argue that it is important to have many different players in the browser driver market, and I agree to an extent, but also, you can just fork chromium, and modify it to your will. Why force the entire world to adopt your weird webdriver?
